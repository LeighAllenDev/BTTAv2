# Back To The Arcade Again!

### Code Institute Portfolio Project 04

## Site Overview
This is a revised version of my first project with added features to utilise the skills I have developed since partaking in that project.

While the original **[Back To The Arcade]** site primarily used the **Front-end** and was built solely with **HTML** and **CSS**, this version utilises the **Full-Stack** using the following **languages and frameworks:
* **HTML5**
* **CSS**
* **JavaScript**
* **Python3**
* **Django**
* **Bootstrap**

The bulk of the project is built with Django which is a Python Framework.

The project focuses on a fictional retro arcade based in Brighton that offers customers a nostalgic experience with classic and modern arcade games as well as a selection of modern consoles, it also has an in house food hall. The aim of the site is to give users an overview of all the available services, users are also able to login to their accounts, and register new accounts, to book their visits in advance.
